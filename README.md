# Disutils Team 

Welcome to **Disutils Team**! We're a group of developers focused on creating powerful and efficient bots for various purposes. Our bots, which include **Sentinel**, **Playdis**, **UtiliCore**, **Harmodify**, **HelpDesk**, **Spotlight**, and **PrivateEyes**, are built to make managing, entertaining, securing, and moderating digital communities easier. 

While Disutils has a variety of bots designed to make discord a better place, **none of these bots are open source**. This means that our codebase is private and isn't available for public access. However, we’re constantly looking to expand our team and collaborate with talented people who share our vision.
